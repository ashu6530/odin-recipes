    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Central New York dish is a perfect way to use up your Thanksgiving leftovers in a baked casserole version that includes turkey instead of the usual chicken</p>
    <p>If you like chicken riggies, I think you're going to love turkey riggies, especially if you're trying to disappear the last of the Thanksgiving leftovers. We cover this every year, but after a day of leftovers, and another day of sandwiches, we're usually in the mood for something a different, and this really fits the bill</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds cooked, chopped turkey meat</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped pepperoncini peppers</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped, pitted kalamata olives</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Chop leftover turkey and place in a mixing bowl. Add pepperoncini peppers and kalamata olives; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add Italian sausage and cook until sausage is browned and crumbled, breaking it up into small pieces, about 5 minutes. Add diced onions, mushrooms, and salt. Cook until onions are soft and start to get translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Deglaze the bottom of the pot with white wine and simmer until wine has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add chicken broth, marinara sauce, water, and cream. Add turkey mixture and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Drain. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
